## evanmunro.github.io

This is the Github repository for my personal website, located at www.evanmunro.ca.

The website began as a clone of kieranrcampbell.github.io, which in turn was inspired by Prof. Alexandre Bouchard's [personal website](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/).

The website uses the [narrow jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/examples/jumbotron-narrow/) Bootstrap theme.
